            • X As a seasoned software engineer, I streamline the complexities
            of website development. Discovery: I initiate a one-on-one meeting
            to understand your goals and requirements. This sets the foundation
            for defining your website's features and objectives. Proposal: Based
            on our discussions, I conduct in-depth research and present a
            tailored proposal. Upon your approval, we kick-start the design,
            development, and deployment phases. Tech Expertise: With my
            expertise, you won't have to worry about choosing the right tech
            stack or selecting a web hosting provider. Project Management: I
            ensure transparent communication throughout the project, keeping you
            informed and allowing you to focus on other crucial business
            activities. Ongoing Support: Post-deployment, I offer website
            management and maintenance services, aligning with the parameters
            set in the proposal.
